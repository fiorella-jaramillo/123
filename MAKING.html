  <h2>What design means for you?</h2>

  <p>Design is to express through any technique, tool, using any method, an option to a solution in that specific time-lapse that is closely related to me,
     sometimes it is not that close but it became somehow a situation that I love, like, live, and I feel it might work because it works for me due to my 
     perception. In this process, I´m trying to have empathy for other humans or non-humans who are part of the experience; making an effort to embodied in
      them, as well as living all the processes that this involves.o embodied like them, as well as living all the processes that this involves. </p>

  <p>It is a sensibility of how I recognize my environment and how I am motivated to express a new way of how things can be done. It is part of my biography,
     it is my emerging subconscious that is looking for new adventures. It is the joyful and amusing expression of my understanding to hack minds, perceptions,
      and beliefs. It is a step further than satisfied my curiosity and subtle look to the beyond of any situation.</p>
  <br>

  <h2>How can design help you to achieve your purpose?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>I consider that design gives you tools and methods to expand on what you want to express and convey as an activity you wish to do for any reason; 
    and your purpose is a path more substantial, considerable open, related to your human-life balance and your spiritual goals; besides that, the purpose
     could be nuanced along the way with more balances or karmas which is what enriches our human experience.  Consequently, you can decide to use design, 
    as stated above, to achieve our purpose or not. 
    </p>

    <p>In my case, it took a while to recognize and feel my purpose in life and understand how I can fusión with my professional background, and after that
       identification, find options to enrich and redirect my path, that was not that away from what I used to do, but from what I used to do as a hobby.
      </p>
