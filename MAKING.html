  <h2>What design means for you?</h2>

  <p>Design is expressing through any technique, tool, or  <i> something </i> an option to a solution in that specific time-lapse that is close
     related to me, sometimes it is not that closely but it became somehow a situation that I love, like, live, and I feel it might work because 
     it works for me due to my perception. In this process I´m trying to have empathy for other humans or non-humans who are part of the experience;
      making an effort to embodied like them, as well as living all the processes that this involves. </p>

  <p>It is a sensibility of how I recognize my environment and how I am motivated to express a new way of how things can be done, or just because of
     the joyful and amusing expression of my understanding. </p>

  <p>It is a step  further that satisfies my curiosity and subtle look to the beyond.</p>

  <h2>How design can be used to transform your world?</h2>
