<h2>BIOMATERIALS with LAURA FREIXAS</h2>

<P>In this second part of the experimentation with biomaterials, we explore the waste in context and how can we make part of the cycles
  of the food as a waste. What opportunities we have as a community to use them, and also, where do we have to start looking 
for them.
</P>

<p>In this seminar, I discovered that people involved in the matter of biomaterials are not unifying forces to manage the waste; 
  what I mean is that, people just collect it to develop whatever they need to and thats it. And the question is, <i>What´s next?,</i> or <i>what happened
    after we finish what we are doing?</i>

   <BR/>
   <P>As a group by initiative of <a href="https://andrea-arranz.github.io/website/">Andrea</a> we chose <i> the flowers of the cementery</i> as a great opportunity
    to <b> develop a design with meaning</b>. We start with pick them up from the waste container in the cementery, we ask for permission and it was easy, 
    the next time wasn´t neccesary to do it.
  </P>

  <p>The idea is to develop a <b> jewelry accessory for the heardo</b>, that is used in the funerals by the closed family as a spanish tradition.
  </p>

  <p>We thought at the begining in fabricate a "big" mould and then sculp it in the LASER CUT MACHINE, but because of the smokes it wasn´t accepted. So, 
    what we had realized is that we require a special-design-mould for the <i>jewelry</i>and the only resourses that we had in that time was a 2D one. </p>
   
    <p>At the end, it didn´t work due to the shape of the mould, and also we tried to used release agent instead of the paper.</p>
