<h2>MY WORK SPACE <b>RtD TOOLBOX</b></h2>
<p>   
  At the beggining of this excercise, it was very difficult to understand what is my worksapace right now, today, I live in a new city very far away from home, I didn´t bring any tool or equipment, I don´t know where find stuff I could need, new poeple around, and many others facts that question my stability.  However, I have realize that I have very cool workshops, new mentors and people, literally, from around the world with similars interests than me. And, of course, I have me. :)
