    <h2>MIGRATION</h2>

    <P>What if Arequipa city becomes more cosmopolitan? Local people prefer to stay here instead of going other main cities and people near Arequipa 
      start migrating here for a better quality lifestyle.  Air pollution, traffic jam,transportation system, and infrastructure will be planned 
      better for this new Cosmo Arequipa city since SAU (South American Union) will help us do that.
      <BR/>
      People start living in the valley near Cosmo-Arequipa. Now we only have 1 million people living, as soon we are going to reach to about 5 million
      people and that will be enough for maintaining resources by ourselves.
      </P>

      <h2>DATA GOVERNANCE</h2>

      <P>It is recently  collected by a system of  tiny local ¨trade.
        <BR/>
      What if South American Union supports more online environment transactions
       of Arequipa city to be more cosmopolitan? We will make good universities, job opportunities that will increase  people to stay in the city.
      </P>

      <h2>WEALTH CONCENTRATION</h2>
      <P>What if there is more cosmopolitan cities like Cosmo Arequipa appear? The money starts to decentralized, so that many cities can be more 
        sufficient and independent. Before only some certain cities have money to govern people so that some people was not able to get social support,
         but it is not going to be the problem anymore.</P>
  
         <h2>WATER</h2>
         <P>What if Arequipa maintains a few water natural resources? Because we have natural springs near the city, people can drink it naturally and we 
         can preserve it by making a circulation system. In this case mineral mining center will be more controlled by government and kept by communities.
        </P>

        <P>What if there is more entertainment, cultural, and leisure activities in the Arequipa? This will generate more fluency of people in the city, 
          so it becomes safer at night. This also leads to the job opportunities for local people as well.</P>
