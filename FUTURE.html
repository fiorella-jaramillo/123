  <h2>REFLECTIONS</h2>

<p style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156);"> <b>°°DESIGNERS INFLUENCE IN DESIGN</b></pstyle>
  <P>I was surprised in a good way and loved the lecture; sometimes there are situations that we ignore but in reality, if we don't say them,
     they may not be. As it is the case that  <i><b>the designer influences the design </b> </i>  and it is better to take into account their background, 
     their beliefs, their subjectivities, emotions, among others. Instead of hiding them or not taking them into account.
      This in particular helps me as a designer because I feel that my influences, my origins and ways influence what I design all the time,
       however, I had not put it into perspective, I think that taking it into account helps me and could even improve my creative processes 
       and that of others too.</P>
  <p>Besides, I felt reflected in the <i><b>mode of inquiry </b>to articulate, propose alternative, provoke reflections</i>, because that is my movement rightnow
  with every action I take because of my subjectivities and beliefs.</p>
  <p>I think that to write this reflection today (march) has more sense to me than before, because of the context of the interventions, and many possibilities that
    might emerge for it, and in the same time, because we are not sure if an <i>intervention</i> is a real or validated <i>intervention.</i>, and the
    <i><b> ethnography</b></i> and <i><b>autobiographical design concepts </b></i> make sense.
  </p>

  <p>In addition, the types of documentation she uses to organize the data show us some features that we must have on mind to start the same process.</p>

     <P>
      I loved the visit to the hospitalet, and I felt saul deza, our host, it was interesting because I shared with my peers from Latin America - 
      South America, it seemed that what he liked was that he had "something" that for our perception was a similar to the <i>informal</i>, the <i>cachinero</i>,
      the <i>clandestine</i>, the <i>recyclers</i> , and <i>underground</i> , which characterizes many areas of Latin America.</P>

 <p style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156);"> <b>°°WHAT KIND OF FUTURES WE WANT?</b></pstyle>
  <P>
    Sergio made us question our point of view regarding our projects and if we were being inclusive,
     responsible, if we knew what our project could trigger if we executed it, and if we were reflecting enough (and if we knew what it meant). </P>
 <p>at first it was something political and social, with ideals that I highlight as the <i><b>mutually shaped</b></i> and the <i><b>co-produced</b></i>, which was what you
    take interested me. And also the meaning of the object and how it is configured, seeing that it is beyond the object, I love when the readings 
    become reflexive, because for me everything has an encrypted message that only some of us read, others feel and others only live.</p>
 <p>
  And something that leaves me thinking, that I see my notes and I just did my reflection is "what is going to happen with our projects after the 
  master finishes?, are we anticipating the future?</p>
