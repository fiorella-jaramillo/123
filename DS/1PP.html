 <h2>1ST INTERVENTION OF TERM 2</h2>

<p>After the first term, I decided to start a new path for interventions, <b> waste </b> in general. And continue in parallel with the path that
   emerged in the last term, the <b>holistic </b> one.</p>
<p>I don´t know if they will merge in somepoint or they just will complement eachother, or they just will continue different routes.</p>
  
<p>I am very  attracted to the significanse of materials and its bifurcation in physics (measurements, features and properties) and in subjective
   (senses, messages behind, holistic properties and beyond), because of this, it is relevant to me show experiences colored by that. 
   Developing experiences to think, to question, to observe, to play with, and so on; through the presumption of the spiritual and magic.

 <p style="color: rgb(129, 185, 207);"> <b>CONTEXT</b></pstyle> 
    <p>
    I have been segregating some of my food peels, during the last term to see what could I do next, without see it as an opportunity or to document it.
     When we were ask to bring some to one of the seminars they worked perfectly, they were a lot and they were desidratated and free of bacterias. <br/>
    So I restarted again, and, in some point of the last weeks I saw a bunch of <b> carboard boxes</b> with segregated materials in my bedroom, then I thought
     that maybe, all of them might need their own organized space in the flat.<br/>
    </p> <p>
    The question was <i>what can I do with them?; how much can I still contain in my room?; what if my roommates join?; what if my building join?. what if my
      some people of my block join?, how is the type of person that could join and why?</i></p>
    <p>In addition, the biomaterials seminars was running and many cool option appeared, and also, projects like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/remixelbarrio/?hl=en"><b>"Remix El Barrio" </b></a>, 
      <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/"><b>"Reflow Project" </b></a>, among others very inspiring that can offer many options and opportunities in this
       topic, but still many of them continue having problems of how to sustaine theirself economicaly.</p>
   <p>
  In that case, how can I join somehow to that community?, why it is not rentable if it is very attractive for users and governments, where is the segment
   in which they are struggling to optimize their processes?.  what if I offer the waste I collect?, how many of the collected is required to  have options
    of develop "something"?. Because, what I have realized is that what "we" are looking for comercial stores because they already have the same of one
     product-waste in the same container or bag. Few of them segregate, and also, it is kind of hard because it require time and some requirements.
      Not to mencionate that it has to be daily, because they occupy space, and probably they smell weird if it is not; unless we find a solution
       that suits them. As well as, the correct dehidratation of them due to the bacterias.
  </p>
  <p style="color: rgb(129, 185, 207);"> <b>BOXES AT HOME</b></pstyle> 
    <P>A fact of this process is that I am not collecting all of my waste, because of the space, or smells. And another situation is that I´m interested in 
      develop some experiments with some of the waste I collect, but not for every type.</p>

  <img width=100% src="1PP/0.jpg"/>

  <p style="color: rgb(129, 185, 207);"> <b>WHAT DO I WASTE (MORE)?</b></pstyle><br/>

    <p>
      This photos are from food waste. I usually recycle very specific non-biomaterials waste because they require more space. In addition, I collect the 
      seeds of the food to reproduced them in the next season.
      </p>
      <img width=100% src="1PP/seeds.png"/>
    <p>Separating every packaging I have realized that many of them are difficult to separate because they are stickers or have joints too attached to each
       others. </p>  
       <img width=100% src="1PP/3.jpg"/>
     <p>What I waste more are peels and seeds of avocado, eggshell, lemon, orange, chocolate wrappers, plastic containers from yogurt and animals meat, and paper.
        In less quantity, fruits like mango, papaya, ciruela, mandarina; more types of plastic, some cans and glass.</p>

    <p style="color: rgb(129, 185, 207);"> <b>COMPOST - SOFT COMPOST?</b></pstyle><br/>
      <p>As a part of the last term experimentation, I tried worms compost to improve my abilities of recirculation processes; and also, because I wanted to 
        generate electricity with them, but they died. Apparently, they were changed in their environment many times that they freeze, also, I bought them
         too soon. One of the reasons to not survive is the food I gave them, they weren't enough decompose. </p>

    <P>I will continue this term with the compost having the mentoring of <b>Compost MDEF Project</b> from Emilio and Rei.</P>

    <p>An important question that appeared from the compost experience was what if I compost just <i> "somethings" </i>,to avoid not welcome smells, and with
    the time lets increasing the ingredientes. It is important to understand how it works, why it can be wet and why it could be wet , and so on. And I want
    to avoid any weird smell because my roommates are going to be part of the collecting.</p>


  <p style="color: rgb(129, 185, 207);"> <b>WHAT IS THE PLAN?</b></pstyle>
    <p>The plan is to develop a <b>WASTE CONTAINER</b> in my flat which it is going to be separated by types in the way I was doing it, with the option of mutate
    acording it is been used.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Invite and explain to my 3  roomates how to use the container, and check how they used it and what feedback I have from them.</p>

    <p> <b>Check list before start</b>   <BR/><BR/>
    
             1. Porous material, like cardboard or clay. Or, other material like plastic or acrilic but with holes.<BR/>
             2. Ventilation, the air has to get IN and OUT of the container.<BR/>
             3. Protection, some of the materials require to be close because they are more vulnerable to bacterias.<BR/>
             4. Divided by size of the waste, and quantity of use.<BR/>
             5. Be aware that some of the materials dripping liquids.<BR/>
             6. Most of them has to be clean.<BR/>
             7. The smallest possible to be accepted in the flat.<BR/>
             8. Some of the peels like oranges smell good, try to put in a specific spot.<BR/>
             9. Have in mind the continuity of use of each material waste.<BR/>
             10.Find where to put them once they space of the waste containter is full. Who is experimenting and working with
             these materials. <BR/>
             11. <b>Important: select what materials I can collect. </b>
            </p>


 <p>Test it.</p>

  <p style="color: rgb(129, 185, 207);"> <b>SHARING WITH FLATMATES</b></pstyle>


    <p>They were already in cardboard, but I will develop in transparent acrilic to let visible what we are collecting, then I think it could be interesting 
    to develop it with the materials I collect.</p>
  <p>
    Once the container is installed; as a daily routine: the <b>WASTE CONTAINER</b> must to be checked and fill the documentation paper check.<BR/>
    The idea of the intervention is to visualize the opportunity of the material to reincarnated in objects for design or art. And generate and engagement
     with the people that contribute to collect. And contribute with biomaterial community with the storage and transaccion of the waste.
      </p>

      <p style="color: rgb(129, 185, 207);"> <b>SELECTED MATERIALS</b></pstyle> 

        <p>These are selected because I consume more and by affinity. The sizes are based on my daily aproximated routine, but this has to be up-dated when my
          flatmates join to the intervention.

  <p>
       + Make boxes of two or three cabins to share with people and test if it is handy. <br>
       + Contrast material is think it might be easy to collect according to my experience with materials the users consume.<br>
       + Document the process first week daily, then weekly.<br>
       + Change the materiales to collect.<br>
       + Check the possibility of encrease the box. (it has to be modular and stackable).<br>
       + Find and connect with the projects in the community to give give them the storaged.<br>
