 <h2>ME IN CONTEXT</h2>

<P>At the beginning of the master's program, I decided to stay open to whatever emerged from my inner self as a response to the knowledge received. And I can say that the evolution of my project was generated intuitively. I started without knowing what the result would be, with no expectations. In addition, I wanted to learn new methods of design, and I thought that in order to achieve that, I had to start with something new and no related to anything I had worked with before.
</P>
 <P>
  This novelty appeared with what I had been experiencing on a personal level, which was also very new for me as well. In such manner, I took the opportunity to explore spiritual fields.
  </P>   
<P>For me, spirituality has been the constant search for self-knowledge and being present in real-time, and in order to achieve that, I look for many techniques and practices that have been evolving over time and constantly amplifying</P>
<P>Because of this context, I agreed to immerse myself in the design process given by the master's program, and find a spiritual community to interact with. And, I attracted a community in the initial process of creation, I can say that I was a founding member, but then due to the lack of time I had to quit. They love to be part of my experiments, I think because they receive information that they value and because of the time interacting together, we became friends.</P>
<P>At some point in my design process with this community, I had to put boundaries in the experiences. Adding more inputs to have specific outputs work for the interventions.</P>
<P>By other hand, my background in architecture generating installations makes me want to make all these processes happen in the streets, on an urban scale context and share  the experiences with those who are not part of the community even though they don't know or I feel what we feel, I believe they have the chance to be rediscovered is they want to explore new possibilities.
</P>
<P>
  I even believe that for people who are not linked to the community these experiences could be games of self-knowledge or a simulation of a fortune cookie, for instance.</P>

  <h2>PERSONAL GROWTH JOURNEY THROUGHOUT THE MASTER´S PROGRAM</h2>
<P>Before starting the master's, I came with expectations of addressing the design process from a different point of view than the one I already had, which was architecture and engineering background.I feel that I entered into a process of unlearning and making space for new techniques and ways to develop.
</P>
<P>However, I already had design experiences outside those contexts, more playful experiences through art, what I achieved was very intuitive. And now I think that the master has helped me to understand different and various possibilities of design in community contexts.</P>
 <P>I conclude that I have the same thoughts about what I want  to  produce in professional fields linked to my purpose in life. However, now I have more tools and a different vision of how to address the design process to accomplish what I want.</P>

<P>In addition, some moments of the master´s program were confusing for me because I had that sensation that it is designed for people that don´t know what to do in their professional fields and the master's is an invitation to rediscover themself, there are plenty time focus on this. Besides, once it is discovered continue focusing on that path.</P>
<P>And, for me, even though, my master's project is related to spiritual tech, it doesn´t mean that I will focus only on this; in parallel, I have other projects, and what I love about them is that they are random.</P>
<h2>WHAT´S NEXT FOR ME?</h2>
<P>I feel confident and with more tools learned to start thinking in what I want to do next. I consider that with the proper time I can reorganized projects that I already have, and add to the list this spiritual tech one.</P>
<P>I have learned that communication, branding, and documentation are the fundamental part of the ejecucion of a project. And I don´t pay attention that much to them.  I must focus on that.
</P>
