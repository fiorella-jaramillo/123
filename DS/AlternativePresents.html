 <h2>WHY I´M DOING WHAT I´M DOING</h2>

<P>These interventions have a link to My Fight, and are related to the search to properly connect with nature and other beings while living in the city; my feedback was first you must connect with yourself. And that was the start of this journey with the holistic community. 

</p> <p>
  However, I´m very interested in many other fields as well, and what I can see now in retrospect is the fusion of my interests using the tools I have as a response to My Fight.</P>

<h2>QUALITIES OF MY PROJECT</h2>
    
<p>My project is related to the spiritual opening by using contemporary technologies as tools, and playing around with the idea if by any chance spiritual experiences can be recreated.  Having as background a community which I have been working with for the past five months.</p>


<h2>WHAT KIND OF CHANGES WILL BE CREATED</h2>
<p>As is well-known holistic practices are related to certain moods, and speed, and are referred to as ancestral practices of many cultures. By other hand, there is an encreasing movement of artist, designers, among other expertises that are looking for spiritual approaches using the tools they have.  </p>

<p>However, from my perspective, it seems that it is not happening in the opposite direction very often.  Therefore, my project is looking for a holistic community to use contemporary technologies as tools to generate readings (for instance) since, I have the same abilities they have, and I´m part of both worlds.</p>
  
<h2>CAN I SCALE THIS UP?</h2>
<p>I think that it could scale up as a movement of the spiritual-tech, and also as an incentivization for holistic communities to use new technologies to generate variety in their practices. In addition, I think it could be used by people that look for spiritual purposes.</p>

<h2>ABOUT EXPANDING THE COMMUNITY</h2>
<p>I can say the best option for me to expand the community is an exposition of the practices on the streets and parks. In addition, social media, an app, or a web platform. However, my possition as part of the community is to generate this atmospheres­ in the city  to gather people because it's what I love the most to do</p>

<h2>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL METHODS?</h2>
<p>Traditional methods are part of the daily spiritual practices. In fact, what I think is that part of the movement is the reconciliation with the ancestral methods.
</p>

<p>What I am creating is a type of interface with contemporary tools to pop up the ancestral knowledge from natural beings, like fruits and plants as entities to connect with yourself.
</p>

<h2>MY PROJECT IN OTHER CONTEXTS WITH OTHER ACTORS</h2>
<p>What I am designing is very speculative for rational context. Nonetheless, for the community makes total sense.  For these reason, I believe that the project can be replicated, adaptated, fusion with other tecniques, and so on; in a context with similar behaviours.</p>
<p>Besides, the search for the connection with the spiritual is worldwide and non-religion. And it has been increasing with the lockdown in the pandemic years. </p>

<h2>PARALLEL REALITIES</h2>
<p>A parallel reality might be people sensing deeply the experience and start  knowing themself.

  That reality in which the respect for the ancestral knowledge became contemporary. Where we coexist peacefully with nature, even though we are in the cities because now we understand the meaning of why we do what we do and want.  </p>

  <h2>WAYS OF COMMUNICATION</h2>
<p>Communication is fundamental and depends on the public you are referring to. And that is one of the most valuable learning from the latest months.

  The language to communicate to the holistic community the project is one and easier, and to communicate the project in an academic context is complex because the communication is related to the cognitive process more than ethereal openings to be understood.  
  
  The first one is linked to sensations, feelings, and messages from the analog metaverse; and the other one is more facts, and action/reaction objective processes.
