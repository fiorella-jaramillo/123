<div class="cuerpitocentral">

 <h2>CONTEXT</h2>

<P>After the previous intervention related to the smells and senses with an holistic community and non-holistic random people I concluded that, for me, it was crucial to show and be understood by both sides.  Especially for the non-holistic one because the first one is open to life experiences that involve their senses even though it means going vulnerable, besides, it is more attractive for them if we convey the meaning beyond the senses.  </P>
 <P>However, the ones that are not part of the community, somehow are related to what My Fight was about at the beginning of all these chapters, which was related to self-know in order to connect with others and nature.</P>   
 <P>Moreover, it is meaningful if I can express the first -person perspective research through design done in the past months with a multidisciplinary professionals in the spiritual fields. Despite the fact that some people believe in spiritual practices or not; it goes beyond my perception and I´m very interested in how spirituality and technology can merge and  create new experiences with different approaches as we know so far.</P>
 <P>From my perspective, spirituality goes beyond quite a mood, slow movement practices, or breathing; for me, it is being present to feel you (meaning feel your spirit), and there are plenty of ways to achieve that.</P>
 <P>For this reason, technology appears as a contemporary tool to play with it, and merge with it, and provoke open question about if there is a possibility to redo the same holistic experiencience using it with other agencies; to query if these spiritual experiences lose or gain any spark in the way, if they generate attachment, or if it is just another option interface to connect people with the spiritual. </P>
 <P>In addition, observe how the holistic community holds this new mechanism to practice as new and contemporary rituals to be ntegrated.</P>
 <p>Therefore, these next interventions were design thinking in how I can reinterpret and transmit to other humans what people with the spiritual opening can feel without any input -item to activate their senses using a contemporary technology interface as the main tool. </p>
 
 <p style="background-color: rgb(118, 80, 180); padding:10px;"><B>DISSCUSSIONS AT THE ROUND TABLE WITH EXPERTS <br>
  USING CONTEMPORARY TECHNOLOGIES FOR HOLISTIC PRACTICES</B></pstyle>
  <p style="color: rgb(118, 80, 180);"> <b>CONTEXT AND FACTS</b></pstyle>
    
<P>During my research journey in understanding cognitive processes through holistic practices, I was invited to be part of a Holistic House in Gracia named VLAZKAR five months ago.  Getting close to interdisciplinary experts in spiritual fields made me understand that they use different agencies to work with people, and even though each of them uses a specif technique, the final output is similar if they focus on the same target. 
</P>
<P>
  These experiences make me recognize the possibility of using other techniques  (ancestrals or contemporaries) to have a similar output as a target in holistic contexts.
  </P>
<P>Some of the members of this House were in the previous holistic intervention with fruits and the speculative sesion of  the dryer artifact that might cause the smells.</P>
 
<p style="color: rgb(118, 80, 180);"> <b>THE EXPERTS IN SPIRITUAL FIELDS IN THE HOLISTIC HOUSE</b></pstyle>

<P>Some of them practices many tecquiques, and the fields are related to Astrology, Reiki, Systems Contellations, Akashic Records, Tarot, Pendulo.  In addition, some of them are artists and musicians as well.</P>
<p style="color: rgb(118, 80, 180);"> <b>TCONTEMPORARY TECHNOLOGIES AND NATURE AGENCIES IN CONTEXT</b></pstyle>

<P>Some of the contemporary technologies can make us interact with our senses through their mechanisms or interfaces.  In context, they might be used to create spiritual experiences or to stimulate our senses for spiritual purposes.</P>
 <P>They are referred to electronic systems, sensors and programming that are going to be used as tool to activate smells,  to measure  the movement in our bodies, and to generate the interfase for the reading of the experience.</P>
<P>The agency of natural technology; for instance, the fruits, plants, or other beings as an input to activate sensations in our body; generates remembrances in our soul and reaches our brains.</P>
<p style="color: rgb(118, 80, 180);"> <b>WHAT ARE WE QUESTION?</b></pstyle>
<P>The intention of the Discussion at the Round Table is to question the using of contemporary technologies and nature agencies to catalyst experiences for holistic practices and spiritual proposes.
<BR>
  How these interfaces might affect  the development of holistic practices or not?
  <BR>
  What are the ethical boundaries of these tech interfaces and what are the limits of the holistic community as a terapists when is used random programming to obtain certain outputs?
  <BR>
  Which barriers do the contemporary technologies have to collect the data on the mood of the holistic practices? </P>


  <p style="color: rgb(118, 80, 180);"> <b>THE SESSION</b></pstyle>

    <P>Place:                 Club Holistico Creativo Vlazkar <BR>
      Gracia - BCN<BR>
 Session Time:   1:30 hrs.<BR>
 Language:         Spanish<BR>
 Persons:            5 <BR></P>

<P> wanted to motived inviting people to play, especulate and to project how they might feel if they actually live these alternative realities using tech. By using different format, narratives and tools.</P>
<P>In the first part of the session, I introduce and put on the table concepts to visualize what they mean to us, like technology, agency, holistic and spiritual. After that, we moved on to the questions.</P>

<H2>THE TARGET OF THE SESSION</H2>
<P>It is to create an conversation on what we, as a community, should know and how to get involved in the use of other technologies for spiritual purposes.</P>

<H2>THE LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION</H2>
<P>There is plenty of slang and vocabulary related to the practices that  holistic community understand that inspire the design of the stickers to the session. </P>

<H2>FORMAT OF PARTICIPATION</H2>
<P>The paper in which we all write and draw is a roll of non-top paper, so it is appropriate to intervene at the same time, as a game.
<BR>
  The session is a Talks format.</P>

 <H2>NEW WAYS TO BE SPIRITUAL</H2>
<P>As I said before, been spiritual is been present and we can use any method to achieve that. The session itself is spiritual - tech. However, the session is focused on contemporary techonolgies as sensors, electronic systems, interfaces, and so on. And how this can evolve in time in context.</P>

<H2>ETHICS IN HOLISTIC PRACTICES</H2>
<P>Ethical boundaries in holistic practices when is used information of people is a must protocol follow. Because most of the practices are therapeutic.
</P>

<H2>DOCUMENTATION</H2>
<P>The experience was documented in  short videos and audios to express their thoughts, also, drawings, expressions, practices, messages in writting and sticking stikers while we were talking.  In addition, the long paper with the info.</P>
